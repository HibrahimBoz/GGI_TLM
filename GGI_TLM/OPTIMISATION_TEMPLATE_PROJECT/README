The directory OPTIMISATION_TEMPLATE_PROJECT contains a test case for optimisation of a parameterised geometry, in this case a FSS. It is provided here as a template for developing other optimisation projects in GGITLM.

The process for generating a new optimisation project is as follows:

1. Copy the OPTIMISATION_TEMPLATE_PROJECT directory and its contents to a new location:

cp -r OPTIMISATION_TEMPLATE_PROJECT  NEW_DIRECTORY

2. Go into the NEW_DIRECTORY where you should see the following:
OPTIMISATION_EXAMPLE          
run_test_case_include
run_automatic_test
README             

Create a new directory for the project by copying and renaming the template

GGI_TLM_copy_rename OPTIMISATION_EXAMPLE NEW_OPTIMISATION_PROJECT new_name

3. go into the NEW_OPTIMISATION_PROJECT/PROBLEM_SPECIFICATION_FILES directory

cd NEW_OPTIMISATION_PROJECT/PROBLEM_SPECIFICATION_FILES

4. Either edit the existing input file or create a new one for the new project with the parameters to be optimised
   replaced by names. In the example the names start with # and are in capitals (eg #DIM1) to make them easily identifiable.
   
5. Edit or create a GGI_TLM_post_process_in.txt file to post process the results as required
   
6. Edit the optimise_in.txt file to specify the number of parameters to optimise, type of optimisation and maximum number of GGI_TLM trial runs to perform

7. Edit the fortran code optimisation_process.F90. Two processes are required to be coded by the user. Both are in 

SUBROUTINE calculate_function(value)

Firstly the parameters for the GGI_TLM run must be determined from the normalised optimisation parameters

Secondly the results of the simulation must be processed to give a single figure of merit which is to be minimised.

7a.

The subroutine turns the normalised (between 0 and 1) optimisation parameters used internally by the optimiser into the
actual parameters to be used in the GGI_TLM input file. Suitable transformation functions may be used to scale the normalised parameters to a particular range.

e.g. to generate a value between 1 and 10 from the normalised parameter, p, the following could be used:
value=1.0+p*9.0

This part must be coded in the section following the comment line:
! SET THE PROBLEM PARAMETERS FROM THE NORMALISED PARAMETER VALUES

The objet is to create a file PROBLEM_SPECIFICATION_FILES/parameter_definition.dat in the form of the follwing example...
#DIM1=0.545000E-01    
#DIM2=0.400000E-01    
#DIM3=0.250000E-01    
       .
       .
       .

i.e. a line specifying giving each of the parameters in the input file a value 

7b. 

GGI_TLM is run and the results post processed in the normal way by the system call:

  call system("run_GGI_TLM_trial_solution")

The second process that must be coded by the user is the generation of a single value (figure of merit) 
from the results of the simulation, which is to be optimised. In the example we read the S21 of the FSS (S21.fout)
and generate a value which is the sum of all the transmission coefficients in the desired pass bands (880MHz to 920MHz and 
1780MHz to 1820MHz)

The objkective function value to be minimised is placed in the variable 'value' which is returned to the main optimisation process from the subroutine.
