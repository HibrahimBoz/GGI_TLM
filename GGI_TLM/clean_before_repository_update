Version number: ${GGI_TLM_version}
Date: ${GGI_TLM_date}

Features:

Frequency dependent material models.

Frequency dependent thin layer models.

Multi-conductor cable model including shielded cable model with frequency dependent 
parameters plus frequency dependent lumped impedance models.

Outputs suitable for 3D visualisation and animation using paraview.

Sequential and parallel (mpi) implementation

Over 50 example test cases

This is a new project and is still undergoing development, testing and documenting.
