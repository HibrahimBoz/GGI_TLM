Calculation of the ratio of load voltage/ H field  for a magnetic loop antenna.

The calculation gives Vload/Hincident with H incident calculated both from the
illuminating field and as an average over the surface area of the loop.

The result shows a peak at high frequency which is due to a dipole like response
originating from an E field excitation of the antenna. This may be established by altering the incident field in the input file to a field with no H field component through the loop (commented out in 
the input file.)
